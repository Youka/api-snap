# Contributing
First: thanks for your interest in contributing to this project. Help is appreciated even in small portions.  

## Kinds
Possible kinds of contribution are listed below.

### Pull requests
Most helpful is a request to pull your code changes.  
Please fill the pull request (_PR_) template and keep your changes small. If there's much to change, split it into multiple PRs.

### Issues
Describe bugs, feature wishes or optimizations by opening issues. We can discuss about details and how to realize them.

### Maintainers
Currently just one maintainer exists.  
The project is in an early state so it's no problem. More maintainers are welcome later - promised.

## Considerations
* Please try to keep the quality on the same (or even better) level. Investigate the current content to get the idea of it.
* If you're unsure about a bigger change: ask first. We don't want you to waste time and support if possible.
* This is an open source project worked on by developers in their free time. Fast reactions aren't always guaranteed but we try our best.
